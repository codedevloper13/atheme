Description

This is the long description. No limit, and you can use Markdown (as well as in the following sections).

A few notes about the sections above:

    "Contributors" is a comma separated list of wp.orgusernames
    "Stable tag" is not needed for themes
    "Tags" is not needed since these are parsed from the style.css file
    "Requires at least" is the lowest version that the plugin will work on
    "Tested up to" is the highest version that you've successfully used to test the theme. Note that it might work on higher versions... this is just the highest one you've verified.
